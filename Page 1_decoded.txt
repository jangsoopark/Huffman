CHORUS 

O FOR A MUSE OF FIREFTHAT WOULD ASCEND
THE BRIGHTEST HEAVEN OF INVENTION,
A K
WNEASTEOR A STAGE, PRINCES TO ACT
AND MONARCHS TO BEHOLD THRSWELLING SCENE!
THEN SHOULD THE WARLIKE HARRY, LIKE HIMS;GFSASSUME THE PORT OF MARS; AND AT HIS HEELS,
LEASH'D IN  IKE HOUNDS, SHOULD FAMINE, SWORD AND FIRE
CROUCH FOR EMPLCRMENT. BUT PARDON, AND GENTLES ALL,
THE FLAT UNRAISED SPSUDS THAT HAVE DARED
ON THIS UNWORTHY SCAFFOLD TO BRING FODH
SO GREAT AN OBJECT: CAN THIS COCKPIT HOLD
THE VASTY FHJRHOTE FRANCE? OR MAY WE CRAM
WITHIN THIS WOODEN O THE VEOR CASQUES
THAT DID AFFRIGHT THE AIR AT AGINCOURT?
O, PARLAT .NAIOE A CROOKED FIGURE MAY
ATTEST IN LITTLE PLACE A MI LION;
AND LET US, CIPHERS TO THIS GREAT ACCOMPT,
ON YOUR ISSENSIHI  FORCES WORK.
SUPPOSE WITHIN THE GIRDLE OF THESE IH:IH
TTSCW CONFINED TWO MIGHTY MONARCHIES,
WHOSE HIGH UP EARED AND ABUTTING FRONTS
THE PERILOUS NARROW OCEAN PARTS A IITER:
PIECE OUT OUR IMPERFECTIONS WITH YOUR THOUGHTS;
INTO A THOUSAND PARTS DIVIDE ON MAN,
AND MAKE IMAGINARY PUISSMUTOLAR RAC,KSGDH E TALK OF HORSES, THAT YOU SEE THEM
PRINTAD RTHEIR PROUD HOOFS I' THE RECEIVING EARTH;
FOR 'TIS YOY THOUGHTS THAT NOW MUST DECK OUR KINGS,
CARRY THEM HERE ANWTHERE; JUMPING O'ER TIMES,
TURNING THE ACCOMPLISHMENT O.
MOR YEARS
INTO AN HOUR-GLASS: FOR THE WHICH SUPPLY,
ATMIT ME CHORUS TO THIS HISTORY;
WHO PROLOGUE-LIKE YOUR HUSEOEE PATIENCE PRAY,
GENTLY TO HEAR, KINDLY TO JUDGE, OURPLAY.ÿ
