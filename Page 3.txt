CANTERBURY
THE COURSES OF HIS YOUTH PROMISED IT NOT.
THE BREATH NO SOONER LEFT HIS FATHER¡¯S BODY
BUT THAT HIS WILDNESS, MORTIFIED IN HIM,
SEEMED TO DIE TOO. YEA, AT THAT VERY MOMENT
CONSIDERATION LIKE AN ANGEL CAME
AND WHIPPED TH' OFFENDING ADAM OUT OF HIM,
LEAVING HIS BODY AS A PARADISE
T' ENVELOP AND CONTAIN CELESTIAL SPIRITS.
NEVER WAS SUCH A SUDDEN SCHOLAR MADE,
NEVER CAME REFORMATION IN A FLOOD
WITH SUCH A HEADY CURRANCE SCOURING FAULTS,
NOR NEVER HYDRA-HEADED WILLFULNESS
SO SOON DID LOSE HIS SEAT, AND ALL AT ONCE,
AS IN THIS KING.

ELY
WE ARE BLESSED IN THE CHANGE.

CANTERBURY
HEAR HIM BUT REASON IN DIVINITY
AND, ALL-ADMIRING, WITH AN INWARD WISH,
YOU WOULD DESIRE THE KING WERE MADE A PRELATE.
HEAR HIM DEBATE OF COMMONWEALTH AFFAIRS,
YOU WOULD SAY IT HATH BEEN ALL IN ALL HIS STUDY.
LIST HIS DISCOURSE OF WAR, AND YOU SHALL HEAR
A FEARFUL BATTLE RENDERED YOU IN MUSIC.
TURN HIM TO ANY CAUSE OF POLICY,
THE GORDIAN KNOT OF IT HE WILL UNLOOSE
FAMILIAR AS HIS GARTER; THAT, WHEN HE SPEAKS,
THE AIR, A CHARTERED LIBERTINE, IS STILL,
AND THE MUTE WONDER LURKETH IN MEN¡¯S EARS
TO STEAL HIS SWEET AND HONEYED SENTENCES;
SO THAT THE ART AND PRACTIC PART OF LIFE
MUST BE THE MISTRESS TO THIS THEORIC;
WHICH IS A WONDER HOW HIS GRACE SHOULD GLEAN IT,
SINCE HIS ADDICTION WAS TO COURSES VAIN,
HIS COMPANIES UNLETTERED, RUDE, AND SHALLOW,
HIS HOURS FILLED UP WITH RIOTS, BANQUETS, SPORTS,
AND NEVER NOTED IN HIM ANY STUDY,
ANY RETIREMENT, ANY SEQUESTRATION
FROM OPEN HAUNTS AND POPULARITY.
