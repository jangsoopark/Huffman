ACT 1, SCENE 1

CANTERBURY
MY LORD, I'LL TELL YOU THAT SELF BILL IS URGED
WHICH IN TH'ELEVENTH YEAR OF THE LAST KING¡¯S REIGN
WAS LIKE, AND HAD INDEED AGAINST US PASSED
BUT THAT THE SCAMBLING AND UNQUIET TIME
DID PUSH IT OUT OF FARTHER QUESTION.
 
ELY
BUT HOW, MY LORD, SHALL WE RESIST IT NOW?
 
CANTERBURY
IT MUST BE THOUGHT ON. IF IT PASS AGAINST US,
WE LOSE THE BETTER HALF OF OUR POSSESSION,
FOR ALL THE TEMPORAL LANDS WHICH MEN DEVOUT
BY TESTAMENT HAVE GIVEN TO THE CHURCH
WOULD THEY STRIP FROM US, BEING VALUED THUS:
"AS MUCH AS WOULD MAINTAIN, TO THE KING¡¯S HONOR,
FULL FIFTEEN EARLS AND FIFTEEN HUNDRED KNIGHTS,
SIX THOUSAND AND TWO HUNDRED GOOD ESQUIRES;
AND, TO RELIEF OF LAZARS AND WEAK AGE
OF INDIGENT FAINT SOULS PAST CORPORAL TOIL,
A HUNDRED ALMSHOUSES RIGHT WELL SUPPLIED;
AND TO THE COFFERS OF THE KING BESIDES,
A THOUSAND POUNDS BY TH' YEAR." THUS RUNS THE BILL


ELY
THIS WOULD DRINK DEEP.

CANTERBURY
'TWOULD DRINK THE CUP AND ALL.

ELY
BUT WHAT PREVENTION?

CANTERBURY
THE KING IS FULL OF GRACE AND FAIR REGARD.

ELY
AND A TRUE LOVER OF THE HOLY CHURCH.
